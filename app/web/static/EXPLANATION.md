# Static Assets Documentation

## Overview
This document explains the organization and management of static assets in the FoundryCord application. The static assets are organized to optimize performance, maintainability, and scalability.

## Directory Structure
The static assets are organized into the following main directories:
- `css/`: Stylesheets and CSS modules
- `js/`: JavaScript files and modules
- `img/`: Image assets and icons
- `fonts/`: Typography assets
- `vendor/`: Third-party dependencies

## Asset Management Guidelines

### CSS Organization
- Use BEM (Block Element Modifier) methodology for CSS naming
- Organize styles by component
- Maintain a modular architecture
- Use preprocessors for maintainable code
- Implement responsive design patterns

### JavaScript Management
- Use ES6+ modules for code organization
- Implement lazy loading where appropriate
- Bundle and minify for production
- Maintain clear dependency management
- Document module interfaces

### Image Assets
- Optimize all images before committing
- Use appropriate formats (SVG for icons, WebP with fallbacks)
- Implement responsive images
- Maintain consistent naming conventions
- Document image usage and context

### Font Management
- Use web-safe fonts when possible
- Implement font subsetting
- Provide fallback fonts
- Document typography system
- Optimize loading performance

### Vendor Assets
- Regular security audits
- Version control for dependencies
- Document usage and licenses
- Maintain update schedule
- Monitor bundle sizes

## Performance Considerations
1. Asset Optimization
   - Minification
   - Compression
   - Caching strategies
   - Load prioritization

2. Loading Strategies
   - Critical CSS path
   - Async loading
   - Preloading
   - Browser caching

3. Monitoring
   - Performance metrics
   - Asset sizes
   - Load times
   - Cache hit rates

## Development Workflow
1. Asset Creation
   - Follow naming conventions
   - Optimize before commit
   - Document usage
   - Update task list

2. Testing
   - Performance testing
   - Cross-browser testing
   - Responsive testing
   - Accessibility checks

3. Deployment
   - Version assets
   - Update cache headers
   - Monitor metrics
   - Document changes

## Best Practices
1. Always optimize assets before deployment
2. Maintain clear documentation
3. Follow established naming conventions
4. Regular performance audits
5. Keep dependencies updated
6. Monitor asset sizes
7. Implement proper caching
8. Use automation where possible

## Security Considerations
1. Regular security audits
2. Safe resource loading
3. Content Security Policy
4. Cross-origin considerations
5. Dependency scanning

## Future Improvements
1. Implement CDN delivery
2. Automated optimization pipeline
3. Enhanced monitoring system
4. Improved build process
5. Advanced caching strategies
