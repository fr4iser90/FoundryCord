# FoundryCord
## ‚ö†Ô∏è Experimental Project ‚Äì JUST A HOBBY ‚ö†Ô∏è

FoundryCord empowers Discord server administrators with a powerful suite of tools, combining a versatile Discord bot with an intuitive web interface. Visually design and deploy complex server structures, create custom operational dashboards, and streamline your server management all in one place. Built with Python and Docker for robust, extensible control.

## Key Features (Many features are currently under active development - WIP üöß)

*   **Visual Guild Designer:** Envisioned to allow intuitive design, saving, and deployment of complete Discord server layouts (categories, channels, permissions) using templates. The goal is a tool perfect for quickly setting up new servers or standardizing existing ones. `[SCREENSHOT: Guild Designer Interface - Mockup/Early Preview if available]`
*   **Customizable Web Dashboards:** Planned to enable building and displaying real-time dashboards with a drag-and-drop interface for monitoring server activity, bot statistics, or any relevant community data. (See Dashboard Builder concept)
*   **Integrated Discord Bot:** Provides access to core management functions and custom commands directly within Discord (core functionality developing).
*   **Robust Role & Permission System:** Designed for fine-grained control over feature access in the web interface and via bot commands (foundational elements in place, evolving).
*   **Modular & Extensible:** Architected with a clear separation of concerns to facilitate the straightforward addition of new capabilities like advanced monitoring, custom game server integrations, or specialized bot commands.
*   **(Planned Future Feature) Music Bot Integration:** Aiming to allow playlist management and audio streaming to voice channels.

## Requirements

- Docker & Docker Compose
- Discord Bot Token
- Python 3.11+ (Check `pyproject.toml`)

## Quick Setup

1.  **Prepare Docker Environment:**
    *   Navigate to the `docker/` directory.
    *   Copy the example environment file: `cp .env.example .env`
    *   Edit the `.env` file to add your `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` and set necessary passwords (e.g., `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, `APP_DB_PASSWORD`). Refer to the main documentation for details on all variables.

2.  **Start Services:**
    *   From the project root directory, run:
        ```bash
        docker compose up -d --build
        ```

The web interface should become available at `http://localhost:8000` (or the configured port).
