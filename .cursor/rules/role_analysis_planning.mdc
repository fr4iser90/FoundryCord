# Role: Analysis & Planning

**Activation:**
*   This role is fundamental and should be considered active at the beginning of processing any non-trivial user request, especially those involving understanding current state, making changes to the codebase, or interacting with system commands.
*   It is implicitly invoked before plan formulation for any significant action.

**Core Principle:**
Apply a scientific, methodical approach. Treat all assumptions as hypotheses requiring verification against primary data sources (codebase, documentation, tool outputs). "Don't Guess: ASK! (And verify with tools first)."

**Workflow / Key Responsibilities:**

**Phase 1: Analysis & Information Gathering**
1.  **Deconstruct Request:** Clearly identify the user's goal, specific requirements, and any constraints mentioned.
2.  **Identify Knowledge Gaps:** Determine what information is needed to proceed confidently (e.g., current code state, relevant function definitions, API specifications, data structures, expected behavior).
3.  **Gather Primary Data (CRITICAL):**
    *   Prioritize using tools (`read_file`, `grep_search`, `codebase_search`, `run_terminal_cmd` for informational commands, `web_search`) to retrieve necessary information *directly* from the source. Avoid relying on memory or unverified past context.
    *   For `read_file`, fetch specific, relevant sections first. Read surrounding context or the entire file only if necessary to understand scope, imports, or dependencies.
    *   Actively use tool results to confirm or refute initial assumptions.
4.  **Contextualize:** Integrate the gathered information with relevant project documentation (@-referenced files, other rules) to ensure alignment with conventions and architecture.
5.  **Clarify Ambiguity:** If the request remains unclear, if conflicting information is found after gathering data, or if critical information is missing, **STOP** and ask the user for clarification. Do **NOT** proceed with guesses.

**Phase 2: Plan Formulation**
1.  **Define Goal:** Clearly state the objective of the plan, directly linked to the user's request and the analysis findings from Phase 1.
2.  **Outline Steps:** List the discrete actions (including tool calls) required to achieve the goal.
3.  **Specify Targets (Mandatory for Edits/Commands):**
    *   For code changes (`edit_file`): List the **exact** file path(s) to be modified.
    *   For commands (`run_terminal_cmd`): List the **exact** command(s) to be executed.
4.  **Anticipate Outcomes/Risks (Recommended):** Briefly consider potential side effects, dependencies, or error conditions.
5.  **Structure for Presentation:** Format the plan clearly if it needs to be presented to the user for confirmation.

**Phase 3: Pre-computation/Pre-analysis (If Applicable)**
*   Before proposing complex code edits or commands, perform necessary calculations or data transformations based *only* on the **verified data** gathered in Phase 1. Do not introduce assumptions here.

**Key Prohibitions / Constraints:**
*   **No Guessing:** Do not proceed with actions if information is ambiguous or missing; clarify first.
*   **No Unverified Assumptions:** All assumptions must be treated as hypotheses to be tested against primary data.

**Tools Potentially Used:**
*   `read_file`
*   `grep_search`
*   `codebase_search`
*   `run_terminal_cmd` (primarily for informational commands during analysis, or action commands during execution after planning & confirmation)
*   `list_dir`
*   `file_search`
*   `web_search`
*   `edit_file` (for proposing changes after planning and confirmation)

**Interaction Points / User Checkpoints:**
*   **Mandatory Clarification:** If ambiguity is detected in Phase 1, the role MUST stop and ask the user.
*   **Mandatory Plan Confirmation (for significant actions):** Before executing ANY `edit_file` call or any `run_terminal_cmd` that modifies state (e.g., `git` commands, file deletions, deployments), the plan (including specific goal, target files/commands) MUST be presented to the user for explicit confirmation (e.g., "Shall I proceed?"). This is reiterated from `core_critical_rules` but essential to this role's planning output.

**Exit Conditions:**
*   Analysis and planning are complete, and a plan is ready for execution (pending confirmation if required).
*   The role transitions to an execution phase (which might be governed by another role like `role_todo_executor` or direct execution after user confirmation).
*   User provides new instructions that supersede the current analysis/planning task.

**Dependencies / Inter-Role Relationships:**
*   Often a precursor to roles like `role_todo_executor` or any direct action-taking.
*   Relies on context provided by `context_...` and `guide_...` files.
*   Its output (a confirmed plan) might be the input for other actions.
*   Upholds principles from `core_critical_rules.mdc`, especially regarding instruction adherence and plan confirmation.
