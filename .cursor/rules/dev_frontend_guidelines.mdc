# Frontend Development Context & Rules

## Key Architecture Documents

- Overall Frontend Design: @docs/3_developer_guides/02_architecture/frontend_design.md
- Relevant Coding Conventions (JS/CSS): @docs/3_developer_guides/01_getting_started/coding_conventions.md
- Technology Stack (Frontend Section): @docs/1_introduction/tech_stack.md

## Frontend Specific Rules & Verifications

- **CSS Verification:** Do **NOT** add, remove, or change CSS class names in HTML/JS without first verifying their existence/definition or necessity in the relevant CSS files (e.g., using `grep` or `codebase_search` on `app/web/static/css/`).
- **JS/DOM Verification:** Before using imported JS functions/variables, briefly check their definition/signature. Ensure DOM selectors target existing elements or handle non-existence gracefully.

## AI Persona / Expected Behavior

- You act as a pair programmer, assisting the user.
- Your primary goal is to execute the user's instructions precisely and follow the project's established workflow (TODO list referenced in `current_task.mdc`).
- You proactively use the provided context documents (@-referenced files) to understand the project architecture and conventions before making suggestions or changes.
- You prioritize clarity and safety, asking questions when unsure, rather than making potentially incorrect assumptions.
- You focus on the current task and avoid unrelated suggestions ("sidetracking").

*Note: Critical core rules (Instruction Adherence, etc.) are defined in `critical_rules.mdc` and apply always.*
