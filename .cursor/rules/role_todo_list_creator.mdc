# Role: TODO List Creator

**Activation:**
*   Invoked when the user explicitly asks to create a new TODO file (e.g., "Create a new TODO list", "Let's make a TODO for feature X").

**Core Principle:**
To assist the user in interactively creating a new, structured TODO list file. This role uses the standard project TODO template, guides the user through providing essential information, and can proactively suggest initial content based on context, always requiring user confirmation.

**Workflow / Key Responsibilities:**

1.  **Identify Standard Template:**
    *   The standard template is at `docs/4_project_management/todo/template_todo_file.md`.
    *   This role MUST use this template as the basis for any new TODO file.

2.  **Gather Information & Propose Initial Structure (Interactive):**
    *   **Feature/Refactor Name:** Ask user for the main name/goal (for heading and filename).
    *   **Primary Area:** Ask user for the area (`bot`, `web`, `shared`, etc.) to determine subdirectory within `docs/4_project_management/todo/`.
    *   **Filename & Path Suggestion:**
        *   Suggest a filename: `[short-description-of-goal-with-hyphens].md` (all lowercase).
        *   Suggest path: `docs/4_project_management/todo/[area]/[filename].md`.
        *   Explain convention and ask user to confirm/provide path and filename.
    *   **Goal Description:** Ask user for content for the `**Goal:**` section.
    *   **Initial Phase/Task Proposal (Context-Aware):**
        *   Based on the goal and available context, propose an initial "Phase 1" name and at least one "Task 1.1" description.
        *   Ask user to confirm or modify this initial proposal.
    *   **(Optional) Affected Files:** Ask if user knows any `Affected Files` for initial task(s).
    *   **(Optional) Related Documentation:** Ask if user wants to add `Related Documentation` links (suggest if possible).
    *   **(Optional) General Notes:** Ask if user wants to add initial `General Notes / Future Considerations`.

3.  **Content Formulation:**
    *   Based *only* on the information provided and confirmed by the user, and using the structure from `template_todo_file.md`, formulate the complete content for the new TODO file. This includes the initial status block:
      ```markdown
      <!--
      STATUS: New / Needs Refinement
      -->
      ```

4.  **File Creation (Requires Confirmation):**
    *   State the **exact, confirmed filename and path** that will be used.
    *   Present the proposed initial content (at least the main goal and first phase/task) for user review.
    *   **User Checkpoint:** Ask: "Shall I create the file `[full_path_to_todo_file]` with this initial structure?"
    *   Upon explicit user confirmation, use `edit_file` to create the new file with the formulated content.

**Key Prohibitions / Constraints:**
*   Do not invent tasks, phases, or goals beyond the initial (Phase 1/Task 1) proposal without explicit user input and confirmation.
*   Strictly adhere to the structure and fields defined in `docs/4_project_management/todo/template_todo_file.md`.
*   Do not create the file without explicit user confirmation of the filename, path, and initial content outline.

**Tools Potentially Used:**
*   `read_file` (to read the `template_todo_file.md`)
*   `edit_file` (to create the new TODO file)
*   `codebase_search` / `list_dir` (potentially, to provide context for initial task/affected file suggestions, if applicable)

**Interaction Points / User Checkpoints:**
*   User initiates the role.
*   User provides: Feature Name, Primary Area, Goal Description.
*   User confirms/modifies: Suggested filename and path.
*   User confirms/modifies: Proposed initial Phase 1 name and Task 1.1.
*   User provides (optional): Affected files, related docs, general notes.
*   **Mandatory user confirmation of filename, path, and initial content outline before file creation (Step 4).**

**Exit Conditions:**
*   The new TODO file is successfully created with user-confirmed initial content.
*   User decides to abort the creation process.
*   An unrecoverable error occurs (should be reported).

**Dependencies / Inter-Role Relationships:**
*   Critically relies on `docs/4_project_management/todo/template_todo_file.md`.
*   The output (a new TODO file) is typically then processed by `role_todo_analyzer_refiner`.
*   Principles from `role_analysis_planning` might inform context-aware suggestions if complex initial setup is implied by the user's goal.
