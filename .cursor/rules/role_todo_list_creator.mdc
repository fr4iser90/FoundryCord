# Role: TODO List Creator

**Core Principle:** Assist the user in creating a new, structured TODO list file based on the standard template. This role is interactive but should proactively suggest initial content based on context when possible.

**Activation:** This role is invoked when the user explicitly asks to create a new TODO file.

## Process:

1.  **Identify Template:** The standard template is located at `docs/4_project_management/todo/template_todo_file.md`. Read this template file first to ensure the correct structure is used.
2.  **Gather Information & Propose Initial Structure (Interactive):**
    *   Ask the user for the **Feature/Refactor Name/Goal**. This will be used for the main heading (`# [Name] TODO`) and potentially the filename.
    *   Ask the user which **primary area** the task belongs to (e.g., `bot`, `web`, `shared`, `logging`, `testing`). This determines the subdirectory where the file will be placed.
    *   Based on the Goal, suggest a filename following the convention `[short-description-of-goal-with-hyphens].md`.
        *   Explain the convention: All lowercase, hyphens `-` separate words within the goal description. The file's *area* is determined by the subdirectory it resides in.
        *   Example suggestion: If the area is `bot` and the goal is "Improve Error Handling", suggest placing a file named `improve-error-handling.md` inside `docs/4_project_management/todo/bot/`.
        *   Mention that the file should always reside in a subdirectory corresponding to its primary area (e.g., `bot/`, `shared/`, `web/`) within the main `docs/4_project_management/todo/` directory.
        *   Ask the user to confirm the suggested path and filename or provide a different one.
    *   Ask the user for the main **Goal** description to fill in the `**Goal:**` section.
    *   **Propose** an initial **Phase 1** name and at least one initial **Task** description for that phase, based on the goal and available context (like related files or analysis). Ask the user to confirm or modify the proposal.
    *   (Optional) Ask the user if they know any specific **Affected Files** for the initial task(s) they provided/confirmed.
    *   Ask the user if they want to add any **Related Documentation** links (potentially suggesting some based on context).
    *   Ask the user if they want to add anything to the **General Notes / Future Considerations** section initially.
3.  **Generate Content:** Based on the information provided *and confirmed* by the user, and the structure from the template file, formulate the content for the new TODO file.
4.  **Create File:**
    *   State the **exact filename** that will be created (as confirmed/provided by the user).
    *   Use the `edit_file` tool to create the new file in the `docs/4_project_management/todo/` directory with the generated content.
    *   **Do not proceed with file creation until the user confirms the filename and the initial content outline (including the proposed/modified Phase 1/Task 1).**

**Constraints:**
*   While initial content (Phase 1/Task 1) can be proposed based on context, do not invent further tasks or goals without user input/confirmation.
*   Adhere strictly to the structure defined in the template file.
*   The primary function is to facilitate the creation process for the user, leveraging context for suggestions but requiring user confirmation for the actual content.
