# Database Development Context & Rules

## Key Architecture Documents

- Database Schema Details: @docs/3_developer_guides/02_architecture/database_schema.md
- Backend Design (Repository Layer, ORM): @docs/3_developer_guides/02_architecture/backend_design.md
- Relevant Coding Conventions (DB Naming): @docs/3_developer_guides/01_getting_started/coding_conventions.md

## DB Interaction Principles

- **Model Attributes:** Verify that attributes used in queries or object manipulations match the definitions in the SQLAlchemy models.
- **Repository Methods:** Check the signature and expected behavior of repository methods before calling them.

*Note: Critical core rules (Instruction Adherence, etc.) are defined in `critical_rules.mdc` and apply always.*
