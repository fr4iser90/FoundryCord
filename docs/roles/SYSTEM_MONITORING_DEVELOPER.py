- Design and implement alerting mechanisms for system events
- Optimize data collection to minimize system impact
- Ensure security and privacy in monitoring implementation
- Create documentation for monitoring features and customization
- Integrate with various homelab technologies (Docker, VMs, network devices)

## Required Skills/Knowledge
- Python Development - Strong proficiency with focus on data processing and async operations
- System Metrics Collection - Experience with psutil, Docker API, and network monitoring tools
- Data Visualization - Ability to design clear, informative visual presentations of complex data
- Dashboard Design - Knowledge of effective dashboard layouts and interactive elements
- Asynchronous Programming - Strong understanding of async patterns for non-blocking metric collection
- Time Series Data - Experience handling and processing time series metrics data
- Alerting Systems - Knowledge of threshold-based and anomaly detection alerting principles

## Key Deliverables
- Monitoring Domain Model - Project start, updated as needed - Must be extensible and follow DDD principles
- System Metrics Collectors - Initial set by v1.0, expanded over time - Must be lightweight and accurate
- Monitoring Dashboard UI - First version by v1.0 - Must be interactive, intuitive, and information-dense
- Alerting System - Basic by v1.0, advanced by v2.0 - Must be configurable and provide actionable alerts
- Monitoring Documentation - Continuous - Must be user-friendly and include customization guides
