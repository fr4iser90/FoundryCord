# HomeLab Discord Bot Action Plan

## Current Status Analysis

After scientifically examining the codebase, I've identified the following key issues and implementation status:

1. **Duplicate Welcome Dashboard Implementation**: 
   - `app/bot/interfaces/dashboards/ui/welcome_dashboard.py`
   - `app/bot/interfaces/dashboards/ui/general.py`
   Both contain nearly identical `WelcomeDashboard` classes.

2. **Conflicting Dashboard Purpose**:
   - `GeneralDashboardUI` currently displays system monitoring information
   - This conflicts with the welcome dashboard functionality

3. **Service Integration Issues**:
   - The `general_dashboard_service` may not be properly initialized
   - System monitoring should be in a dedicated service

4. **Security Implementation Status**:
   - Key security features including key rotation, audit logging, and rate limiting are now implemented
   - Some security features like debug log cleanup still need attention

## Tasks

### 1. Consolidate Welcome Dashboard Implementation
- [âœ…] Compare both implementations line by line to identify any unique functionality
- [âœ…] Create a unified `WelcomeDashboard` class in `welcome_dashboard.py`
- [ ] Remove the duplicate implementation from `general.py`
- [ ] Update any references to use the consolidated implementation

### 2. Create Dedicated System Monitoring Dashboard
- [âœ…] Create new `SystemMonitoringDashboardController` class based on current `GeneralDashboardUI`
- [âœ…] Move system monitoring code from `GeneralDashboardUI` to the new class
- [âœ…] Create a dedicated channel for system monitoring
- [âœ…] Update the dashboard factory to support the new dashboard type

### 3. Refactor GeneralDashboardUI to Use Welcome Dashboard
- [ ] Update `GeneralDashboardUI` to use the welcome dashboard functionality
- [ ] Ensure proper service integration
- [ ] Maintain backward compatibility for existing references

### 4. Update Channel Configuration
- [âœ…] Add monitoring channel to channel configuration
- [ ] Ensure proper routing of dashboards to appropriate channels
- [ ] Update any hardcoded channel references

### 5. Improve Error Handling and Logging
- [ðŸ”„] Add comprehensive error handling to all dashboard classes
- [ ] Improve logging with context-specific information
- [ ] Add fallback mechanisms for critical functionality
- [ ] Remove debug logging of sensitive information

### 6. Security Enhancements
- [âœ…] Implement rate limiting for authentication
- [âœ…] Add session management system
- [âœ…] Create key rotation mechanism
- [âœ…] Implement audit logging system
- [âœ…] Create database user management
- [ ] Implement secure message ID tracking with cleanup
- [ðŸ”„] Complete file transfer security enhancements

### 7. Prepare for Database-Driven Dashboard System
- [âœ…] Analyze current dashboard persistence requirements
- [ðŸ”„] Design database schema for dashboard configurations
- [ðŸ”„] Create abstraction layer for dashboard storage
- [ðŸ”„] Implement repository pattern for dashboard access
- [ðŸ”„] Update dashboard factory to work with database entities

### 8. Create Web UI Foundation
- [ðŸ”„] Research Python web frameworks (Flask/FastAPI recommended)
- [ðŸ”„] Design authentication flow using Discord OAuth
- [ ] Create basic web server structure
- [ ] Implement API endpoints for dashboard management
- [ ] Design UI mockups for dashboard editor

### 9. Build Dashboard Template System
- [ ] Design template data structure
- [ ] Implement template rendering engine
- [ ] Create common template components
- [ ] Build template validation system
- [ ] Develop template versioning mechanism

### 10. Implement Dashboard Migration System
- [ ] Create export functionality for existing dashboards
- [ ] Build import system for database storage
- [ ] Implement validation and error handling
- [ ] Create backup and rollback mechanisms
- [ ] Test migration with various dashboard types

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Analysis and Preparation
1. [âœ…] Perform detailed code analysis to identify all dependencies
2. [âœ…] Create backup of current functionality
3. [âœ…] Document all current behavior for verification

All implementation follows architecture defined in [Design Patterns](../development/patterns/DESIGN_PATTERN.md) and adheres to [Coding Conventions](../development/guidelines/CONVENTIONS.md).

For long-term planning context, see [Milestones](./MILESTONES.md) and [Roadmap](./ROADMAP.md).

### Phase 2: Implementation
1. [âœ…] Create `SystemMonitoringDashboardController` class
2. [âœ…] Update channel configuration
3. [âœ…] Consolidate welcome dashboard implementations
4. [ ] Refactor `GeneralDashboardUI`
5. [âœ…] Update dashboard factory

### Phase 3: Testing and Verification
1. [âœ…] Test each dashboard in isolation
2. [ðŸ”„] Verify all functionality works as expected
3. [ðŸ”„] Test edge cases and error conditions
4. [ðŸ”„] Document any issues and fix them

### Phase 4: Documentation and Cleanup
1. [âœ…] Update all relevant documentation
2. [ðŸ”„] Remove any deprecated code
3. [ðŸ”„] Finalize code comments and docstrings
4. [ðŸ”„] Create knowledge transfer documentation
