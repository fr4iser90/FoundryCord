# Glossary of Terms

This document defines project-specific terms, common abbreviations, Domain-Driven Design (DDD) ubiquitous language, and potentially ambiguous technical terms used within the FoundryCord project and its documentation. It is intended to be a living document, updated as new terms emerge or existing definitions require refinement.

## A

*   **ADR (Architectural Decision Record):** A document that captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences. See [`docs/4_project_management/adr/README.md`](../../4_project_management/adr/README.md).

## D

*   **Dashboard:** In FoundryCord, a customizable web interface page displaying real-time information, statistics, or controls related to a Discord server or the bot itself. Users can often build these using a drag-and-drop interface.
*   **DDD (Domain-Driven Design):** A software design approach that emphasizes modeling the software to match a domain according to input from that domain's experts. Key concepts include Ubiquitous Language, Bounded Contexts, Aggregates, Entities, Value Objects, Repositories, and Domain Services.

## F

*   **FoundryCord:** The name of this project, aimed at providing advanced Discord server management through a web interface and a companion bot.

## G

*   **Guild:** Discord's term for a server.
*   **Guild Designer:** A feature within FoundryCord (primarily in the web interface) that allows users to visually design, configure, save, and apply templates for Discord server structures (categories, channels, roles, permissions).

## U

*   **Ubiquitous Language:** A common, rigorous language shared by developers and domain experts within a specific Bounded Context in Domain-Driven Design.
