# System Architecture

This section provides a deep dive into the architecture of [FoundryCord](../../../1_introduction/glossary.md#foundrycord), covering the overall system design, the structure of individual components, data models, and API specifications.

## Documents

*   **[Architecture Overview (`overview.md`)]**: A high-level introduction to the FoundryCord architecture, its core principles ([DDD](../../../1_introduction/glossary.md#ddd-domain-driven-design), Clean Architecture), key components (Bot, Web, Shared), and how they interact. Includes a C4 model context diagram.
*   **[Project Structure (`project_structure.md`)]**: Describes the organization of the codebase at the top level, explaining the purpose of major directories like `app/`, `shared/`, `web/`, `docs/`, etc.
*   **[Bot Component Structure (`bot_structure.md`)]**: Details the internal architecture of the Discord bot application, including its layers (application, domain, infrastructure, interfaces), key directories, entry points, and configuration loading.
*   **[Web Application Structure (`web_structure.md`)]**: Outlines the architecture of the web interface, covering its layers, directory organization, primary services (API handling, UI rendering), and interaction with the backend.
*   **[Shared Core Structure (`shared_structure.md`)]**: Explains the design and contents of the `shared/` directory, which houses common domain logic, infrastructure components (database, encryption, logging), and services used by both the Bot and Web applications.
*   **[Database Schema (`database_schema.md`)]**: Provides a detailed description of the PostgreSQL database schema, including an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD), definitions of key tables, their relationships, and their relevance to the domain model. How it relates to DDD [Aggregates](../../../1_introduction/glossary.md#ddd-domain-driven-design)/[Entities](../../../1_introduction/glossary.md#ddd-domain-driven-design) if applicable.
*   **[API Specification (`api_specification.md`)]**: Documents the RESTful API provided by FoundryCord, including endpoint definitions, request/response formats, authentication mechanisms, and key use cases.
*   **[Backend Design Principles (`backend_design.md`)]**: Discusses the core design principles applied to the backend development, such as [Domain-Driven Design (DDD)](../../../1_introduction/glossary.md#ddd-domain-driven-design) [aggregates](../../../1_introduction/glossary.md#ddd-domain-driven-design)/[entities](../../../1_introduction/glossary.md#ddd-domain-driven-design), repository patterns, service layers, and dependency injection.
*   **[Frontend Design Principles (`frontend_design.md`)]**: Covers the design philosophy for the frontend, including the choice of frameworks/libraries (HTMX, Alpine.js, TailwindCSS), component structure, API communication patterns, and state management approaches.
*   **[Testing Infrastructure (`tests_structure.md`)]**: Describes the organization of the test suite, including the structure for unit, integration, and potentially end-to-end tests, and how they relate to the main application components.
