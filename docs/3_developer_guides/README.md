# Developer Guides

This section contains comprehensive documentation for developers working on or with the [FoundryCord](../1_introduction/glossary.md#foundrycord) project. It covers everything from initial setup and coding conventions to in-depth architectural details and feature implementation guides.

## Structure

The developer documentation is organized into the following main categories:

*   **[01_getting_started](./01_getting_started/README.md)**: Essential information for new contributors, including setup instructions, coding conventions, and contribution guidelines.
*   **[02_architecture](./02_architecture/README.md)**: Detailed explanations of the system architecture, including project structure, individual component (Bot, Web, Shared) designs, database schema, and API specifications.
*   **[03_core_components](./03_core_components/README.md)**: In-depth looks at the internal workings of critical Bot, Web, and Shared components, including key services, domain logic, and important algorithms.
*   **[04_feature_implementation](./04_feature_implementation/README.md)**: Guides and examples for implementing new features, showcasing workflows and best practices. Includes detailed walkthroughs of existing complex features.
*   **[05_deployment](./05_deployment/README.md)**: Information related to deploying FoundryCord, including environment configuration, build processes, and troubleshooting common deployment issues.

Each subdirectory contains a `README.md` that provides an overview of its specific content and a table of contents for the documents within it.
