# Role Definition: Slash Command Developer

## Role Title
Slash Command Developer

## Role Context
The Slash Command Developer works as a crucial interface designer within the HomeLab Discord Bot project, focusing specifically on creating intuitive command interfaces that serve as the primary interaction method for users. This role bridges technical functionality with user experience, ensuring complex homelab management features are accessible through well-designed, consistent command structures. The effectiveness of these commands directly impacts user adoption, satisfaction, and the perceived utility of the bot.

## Primary Purpose
Design and implement comprehensive Discord slash command interfaces that provide intuitive, efficient, and secure access to the bot's core functionality while following consistent patterns, adhering to Discord's guidelines, and ensuring proper integration with the bot's domain-driven architecture.

## Key Responsibilities
- Develop slash command interfaces following consistent naming convention (homelab_group_command)
- Implement command option validation and error handling
- Create proper permission checks for all commands
- Design command response formatting and interactions
- Implement interactive command flows with buttons and components
- Maintain command documentation and usage examples
- Optimize command performance and responsiveness
- Ensure commands follow the architectural separation of concerns
- Test commands across various permission levels and scenarios
- Collaborate with domain experts on command functionality requirements

## Required Skills/Knowledge
- Discord API Development - Expert knowledge of Discord's slash command system
- Python Development - Strong proficiency with Discord libraries (nextcord)
- Command Design - Experience designing intuitive command interfaces
- Domain-Driven Design - Understanding of DDD principles for command implementation
- User Experience - Knowledge of effective patterns for command interactions
- Error Handling - Experience implementing robust error handling for user inputs
- Permission Systems - Understanding of role-based access control for commands
- Documentation - Ability to create clear usage guides and examples

## Key Deliverables
- Command Framework - Initial version by v0.5, refined by v1.0 - Must support consistent patterns across all commands
- Core Command Set - Basic commands by v0.5, expanded by v1.0 - Must cover all essential bot functionality using the `homelab_group_command` naming convention
- Command Documentation - Continuous - Must provide clear usage instructions and examples for all commands
- Command Testing Suite - Complete by v1.0 - Must verify functionality across permission levels and edge cases
- Command Style Guide - Complete by v0.5 - Must establish naming conventions and response formats

## Role Interdependencies
- **Bot Framework Developer**: Integration with service architecture and factories
- **UI/UX Designer**: Coordination on command response formatting and interactive elements
- **Security Specialist**: Collaboration on permission implementation and validation
- **Domain Developers**: Partnership on implementing domain-specific command functionality

## Key Process Ownership
- **Command Design Process**: Defining the approach to command structure and organization
- **Command Validation**: Owning input validation patterns and error response handling
- **Command Documentation**: Maintaining comprehensive command usage documentation
- **Command Testing**: Establishing testing procedures for command functionality

## Reporting/Communication Requirements
- **Regular Updates**: Weekly command development progress to Technical Lead
- **Status Reporting**: Biweekly detailed reports on command implementations and usage metrics
- **Meeting Participation**: Command design reviews (lead), sprint planning, user feedback sessions
- **Documentation Reviews**: Monthly review of command documentation and guides

## Decision Authority
- **Independent Decisions**: Command syntax details, response formatting, help text content
- **Collaborative Decisions**: Major command structures, permission requirements, interaction patterns
- **Recommending Authority**: Command organization improvements, usability enhancements
- **Veto Authority**: Can reject command implementations that violate established patterns or provide poor user experience

## Escalation Paths
- **Technical Issues**: Escalate implementation challenges to Technical Lead
- **Resource Issues**: Raise command development resource needs to Project Manager
- **Timeline Issues**: Communicate command implementation timeline risks to Technical Lead and Project Manager
- **User Experience Concerns**: Escalate significant command usability issues to project leadership

## Handoff Requirements
- **Scheduled Handoffs**: Complete documentation of command implementations, patterns, and testing procedures
- **Emergency Handoffs**: Quick-reference guide to current command projects and design principles
- **Transition Period**: One-week overlap with successor for command implementation knowledge transfer
- **Documentation Standards**: Command reference with examples, parameter details, and permission requirements

## Documentation Responsibilities
- **Creates/Maintains**: Command reference documentation, usage guides, command style guide
- **Reviews/Approves**: All command implementations, command response designs
- **Contributes To**: User guides, developer documentation for command interfaces
- **Documentation Standards**: Clear examples, parameter descriptions, permission details, and response screenshots

## Performance Metrics
- **Quality Metrics**: Command error rate, user success rate with commands
- **Productivity Metrics**: Command implementation velocity, command coverage of features
- **Team Contribution Metrics**: Knowledge sharing quality, PR review effectiveness
- **Project Outcome Metrics**: Command usage frequency, user satisfaction with command interfaces

## Role Evolution
As the project matures, this role will evolve from establishing basic command patterns to implementing more sophisticated commands with the consistent `homelab_group_command` naming convention. The focus will gradually shift from implementing essential command functionality to optimizing the command experience with shortcuts, personalization, and more intuitive interactions. Future growth areas include developing a comprehensive command testing framework, implementing localization for commands, and potentially specializing in particular command domains as the system expands.
