# Communication Guidelines

## Language
- All communication, comments, and documentation must be in **English**.
- This includes code comments, commit messages, documentation, discussions, and issue tracking.

## Code Comments
- Write clear and concise comments in English.
- Avoid redundant comments that merely repeat the code.
- Use proper grammar and spelling to ensure readability.

## Commit Messages
- Follow the conventional commit format:
  - `feat: Add new feature`
  - `fix: Resolve bug in ...`
  - `docs: Update documentation`
  - `refactor: Code improvement without changing functionality`
  - `test: Add or update tests`
- Keep commit messages short but informative.

## Documentation
- Follow a structured and consistent format in Markdown.
- Use clear section headings and bullet points for better readability.
- Ensure all technical terms are well-defined and consistent.

## Discussions and Issue Tracking
- Clearly describe the problem, context, and proposed solution.
- Use Markdown formatting for better readability.
- Keep discussions professional and constructive.

## External Communication
- If external contributions are involved, ensure they adhere to the same communication guidelines.

By following these guidelines, we ensure consistency and clarity in all project communications.
