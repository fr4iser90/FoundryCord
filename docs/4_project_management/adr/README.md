# Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory logs significant architectural decisions made during the [FoundryCord](docs/1_introduction/glossary.md#foundrycord) project's development. Using [Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)](docs/1_introduction/glossary.md#adr-architectural-decision-record) helps in understanding the reasoning behind choices, especially when looking back at the project's history or when onboarding new team members.

ADRs capture the context of a decision, the different options considered, the final decision taken, and its consequences.

## Format

Each ADR should be a separate Markdown file in this directory, named using the format `NNN-short-title-of-decision.md` (e.g., `001-use-fastapi-framework.md`). They should follow a consistent format, for example (based on Markdown Architectural Decision Records - MADR):

```markdown
# ADR-NNN: Short Title of Decision

*   **Status:** [Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded by ADR-YYY]
*   **Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
*   **Deciders:** [List of people involved in the decision, e.g., Lead Developer, Project Team]

## Context and Problem Statement

Describe the architectural challenge, issue, or problem that needs to be addressed. What is the context driving this decision? What problem are we trying to solve?

## Decision Drivers

*   List the key forces, constraints, and non-functional requirements influencing the decision (e.g., performance needs, maintainability goals, team expertise, existing infrastructure, project deadlines, simplicity vs. feature-richness).

## Considered Options

List and briefly describe the different solutions or approaches that were considered.

*   **Option 1:** [Description of Option 1]
    *   *Pros:* [Advantages of Option 1]

    *   *Pros:* ...
    *   *Cons:* ...
*   *(Add more options as applicable)*

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen Option:** "[Name of Chosen Option]"

**Justification:** Explain in detail why this option was selected over the others. Clearly articulate the reasoning, supported by the decision drivers and a comparison of the options' pros and cons.

### Positive Consequences

*   What are the expected benefits and positive impacts of implementing this decision?
*   How does it help achieve project goals or satisfy requirements?

### Negative Consequences / Risks

*   What are the known downsides, trade-offs, or potential risks associated with this decision?
*   Are there any new problems or complexities introduced?
*   What are the mitigation strategies for these risks, if any?

## Links (Optional)

*   Links to related issues in the project tracker.
*   Links to relevant external documentation, articles, or PoCs.
*   Links to minutes of meetings where this was discussed.
