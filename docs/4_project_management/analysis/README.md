# Analysis & Research Notes

## Purpose

This directory (`docs/4_project_management/analysis/`) is intended to store documents related to preliminary analysis, research, brainstorming, and technical investigations conducted during the [FoundryCord](../../../1_introduction/glossary.md#foundrycord) project lifecycle.

These documents typically precede the creation of more formal artifacts like [Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)](../../../1_introduction/glossary.md#adr-architectural-decision-record) or detailed TODO task lists.

## When to Use This Directory

Consider creating documents here for:

*   **Feature Exploration:** Early-stage brainstorming and high-level design ideas for new features before they are fully scoped.
*   **Technical Investigations:** Notes and findings from researching new technologies, libraries, or approaches to solve a particular problem (e.g., evaluating different caching strategies, investigating a new Discord API feature).
*   **Problem Analysis:** Deeper dives into complex bugs or issues to understand root causes before defining solutions.
*   **Requirements Gathering:** Initial notes and discussions related to new requirements or user stories.
*   **Proof-of-Concept (PoC) Summaries:** If a PoC was built, a summary of its findings, learnings, and recommendations can be stored here.

## Document Format

*   Use Markdown (`.md`) for these documents.
*   Choose a clear and descriptive filename (e.g., `feature-x-initial-thoughts.md`, `investigation-new-caching-library.md`).
*   There isn\'t a strict template, but documents should generally be clear, concise, and state their purpose or the problem being investigated.
*   Include dates and authors if multiple people contribute or if it\'s a point-in-time analysis.

## Relationship to Other Documents

*   **[[ADRs (`../adr/`)](../../../1_introduction/glossary.md#adr-architectural-decision-record)]**: Analysis done here might lead to a formal ADR if a significant architectural decision needs to be made and documented.
*   **TODOs (`../todo/`):** Once analysis leads to actionable development tasks, these should be broken down and documented in the relevant TODO lists.
*   **Developer Guides (`../../3_developer_guides/`):** If an investigation leads to a new standard or a detailed understanding of a component, this might eventually be refined and moved into the main developer guides.

By keeping these preliminary notes organized, the team can maintain a record of its thought processes, research efforts, and the evolution of ideas.
