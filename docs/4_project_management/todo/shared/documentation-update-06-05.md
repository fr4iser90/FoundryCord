# Comprehensive Documentation Audit & Enhancement (06-05) TODO

**Goal:** To systematically audit, review, enhance, and create documentation across the FoundryCord project. This effort aims to ensure all documentation is accurate, comprehensive, consistent, discoverable, and maintainable, aligning with the "Doc Role" guidelines. Special attention will be given to clarifying architectural patterns (including DDD aspects where applicable) and ensuring a rich resource for both users and developers.

**Related Documentation (Mandatory Reading/Context):**
*   `.cursor/rules/doc_role.mdc` (To be populated with the agreed-upon Doc Role definition)
*   `docs/3_developer_guides/01_getting_started/coding_conventions.md`
*   Existing `README.md` (as a starting point for external communication)
*   `docs/3_developer_guides/02_architecture/overview.md` (as a starting point for architectural understanding)

## Phase 1: Foundational Documentation & High-Level Overview (Audit & Enhance)

*   [x] **Task 1.1:** Correct outdated links in the main `README.md`.
    *   **Affected Files:** `README.md`
*   [x] **Task 1.2:** Enhance `README.md` - Project's "Storefront".
    *   **Focus:**
        *   Craft a compelling "Elevator Pitch" / Value Proposition.
        *   Clearly list key features and their primary benefits to the user.
        *   Incorporate placeholders for (or add, if available) 1-2 key screenshots/GIFs (e.g., Guild Designer, Dashboard).
        *   Briefly mention significant existing underlying systems (e.g., robust role system) if they are a selling point.
        *   Hint at 1-2 major planned features (e.g., music bot integration).
        *   Ensure "Quick Setup" is flawless and tested.
    *   **Affected Files:** `README.md`

            *   Add/Update a high-level System Architecture Diagram (C4 model's Context or Container diagram style recommended, Mermaid preferred). Show User -> Web UI -> API -> Bot -> Discord & Database.
            *   Consider a diagram illustrating key data flows (e.g., applying a guild template).
        *   **Component Interaction:** Clearly explain how major components (Bot, Web UI, Shared Services, Database, Discord API, Message Queues if any) interact.
        *   **Bounded Contexts (DDD):** If applicable, identify and briefly describe the main bounded contexts (e.g., Guild Management, User Accounts, Bot Operations, Dashboarding).
    *   **Affected Files:** `docs/3_developer_guides/02_architecture/overview.md`

## Phase 2: Developer Guides - Detailed Architecture & Design (Audit & Enhance)

    *   **Affected Files:** `docs/4_project_management/adr/README.md` and individual ADR files.
*   [ ] **Task 4.2:** Review structure and utility of `docs/4_project_management/analysis/` and existing TODOs.
    *   **Focus:** Is the analysis folder used effectively? Are TODOs clear and actionable? (This task itself is part of that review).

## Phase 5: Structural Integrity, Consistency, & Final Polish (Ongoing & Final Pass)

*   [ ] **Task 5.1:** Create/Update `README.md` files for all major subdirectories within `docs/` that are missing them or have outdated ones (e.g., `docs/1_introduction/README.md`, `docs/2_user_guides/README.md`, etc.).
    *   **Focus:** Each `README.md` should act as a mini table of contents for its section.
*   [ ] **Task 5.2:** Perform a comprehensive consistency check across all documentation (link to `glossary.md` from Task 1.3.2).
    *   **Focus:** Consistent terminology, writing style, voice, tone, formatting of code blocks, admonitions (notes, warnings), etc.
*   [ ] **Task 5.3:** Validate all internal cross-links within the documentation. Create a link map or use tools if possible to find broken/incorrect links.
*   [ ] **Task 5.4:** (Future) Consider automated link checking in CI.

## General Notes / Future Considerations

*   Maintain a list of "Documentation Debt" for items found but not immediately fixed.
*   Consider adding a "Tutorials" section in `docs/` for guided walkthroughs of common end-to-end tasks (e.g., "Creating your first custom dashboard," "Designing and applying a server template from scratch").
*   Re-evaluate if automated documentation generation from code comments (e.g., Sphinx) can supplement `api_specification.md` or other developer docs.
*   Incorporate documentation updates as a mandatory part of the "Definition of Done" for all new features and significant refactors.
*   Schedule periodic (e.g., quarterly) reviews of major documentation sections to combat staleness.
