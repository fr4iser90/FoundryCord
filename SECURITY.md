# Security Documentation
## ⚠️ Experimental Project – JUST A HOBBY ⚠️
## Overview
This document outlines the security measures implemented in the Discord bot, including authentication, encryption, and logging mechanisms.

## 1. Authentication System

### 1.1 Role Hierarchy
The system implements a hierarchical role-based access control (RBAC) with the following levels:
- Super Admin
- Admin
- Moderator
- User
- Guest

### 1.2 Authentication Implementation
- Uses environment variables for role management (`users.py`)
- Role verification through decorators
- Middleware-based authentication checks
- Hierarchical permission inheritance (higher roles include lower role permissions)

### 1.3 Security Concerns
- ⚠️ User IDs are stored in environment variables which could be a single point of failure
- ⚠️ Debug logging of user IDs and roles could expose sensitive information
- ✅ Good separation of concerns between authentication and authorization
- ✅ Proper middleware implementation for global command checks

### Recommendations
1. Implement rate limiting for authentication attempts
2. Add session management
3. Remove debug prints in production for `is_authorized()`
4. Consider implementing a database for user management instead of environment variables

## 2. Encryption System

### 2.1 Implemented Encryption Methods
- Fernet (symmetric encryption)
- AES-256-GCM (authenticated encryption)

### 2.2 Key Features
- ✅ Secure key management through environment variables
- ✅ Proper nonce generation for AES
- ✅ Authentication tags for AES-GCM
- ✅ Support for both string and bytes input

### 2.3 Security Concerns
- ⚠️ Keys stored in environment variables need proper protection
- ⚠️ No key rotation mechanism
- ⚠️ Message ID tracking could lead to memory issues over time

### Recommendations
1. Implement key rotation mechanism
2. Add encryption at rest for sensitive logs
3. Implement secure key distribution system
4. Add message ID cleanup mechanism
5. Consider implementing Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS)

## 3. Response Handling

### 3.1 Response Modes
- Direct Message (DM)
- Ephemeral
- Encrypted Ephemeral (default)

### 3.2 Security Features
- ✅ Encrypted file transfers
- ✅ Secure DM communications
- ✅ Ephemeral message support

### 3.3 Security Concerns
- ⚠️ Temporary files during encrypted transfers
- ⚠️ No maximum file size limits

### Recommendations
1. Implement secure file cleanup
2. Add file size limits
3. Add content type verification
4. Implement message expiry for sensitive content

## 4. Logging System

### 4.1 Features
- Rotating file logs
- Separate console and file handlers
- Structured log format

### 4.2 Security Concerns
- ⚠️ Sensitive information might be logged
- ⚠️ Log files need proper permissions
- ⚠️ No log encryption

### Recommendations
1. Implement log sanitization
2. Add log encryption for sensitive data
3. Implement proper log rotation policies
4. Add audit logging for security events

## 5. Required Security Improvements

### 5.1 High Priority
1. Implement rate limiting
2. Add input validation across all commands
3. Implement secure session management
4. Add encryption for logs containing sensitive data
5. Implement key rotation mechanism

### 5.2 Medium Priority
1. Add audit logging
2. Implement file transfer limits
3. Add content validation
4. Implement user activity monitoring
5. Add automated security scanning

### 5.3 Low Priority
1. Add performance monitoring
2. Implement backup systems
3. Add health checks
4. Create security metrics dashboard

## 6. Environment Variables Required
env
ENCRYPTION_KEY=<Fernet-key>
AES_KEY=<base64-encoded-32-byte-key>
SUPER_ADMINS=username1|id1,username2|id2
ADMINS=username3|id3,username4|id4
MODERATORS=username5|id5,username6|id6
USERS=username7|id7,username8|id8
GUESTS=username9|id9,username10|id10


## 7. Security Best Practices

1. Regular security audits
2. Keep dependencies updated
3. Monitor for suspicious activities
4. Regular backup of critical data
5. Implement proper error handling
6. Use secure communication channels
7. Regular security training for administrators

## 8. Emergency Contacts

Define and maintain a list of emergency contacts for security incidents:
- Security Team Lead
- System Administrator
- Bot Owner
- Discord Server Owner

## 9. Incident Response Plan

1. Immediate response procedures
2. Communication channels
3. Recovery steps
4. Post-incident analysis
5. Documentation requirements


Phase 1: Closing Critical Security Gaps (High Priority)

    Implement Rate Limiting for Authentication
        Limit login attempts per minute.
        Block IPs after multiple failed attempts.

    Enhance Secure Session Management
        Introduce tokens for authenticated sessions.
        Implement automatic session expiration.

    Clean Up Debug Logging
        Remove print() statements with sensitive data.
        Filter out sensitive information from logs.

    Migrate Environment Variables to a Secure Database for User Data
        Move user roles from .env to an encrypted database.
        Implement a secure mechanism for loading and updating user data.

    Improve Key Management
        Securely store AES and Fernet keys (e.g., in a Secrets Manager).
        Introduce key rotation.

Phase 2: Strengthening Data Integrity & Encryption (Medium Priority)

    Harden & Encrypt Logs
        Prevent logging of Personally Identifiable Information (PII).
        Encrypt storage of sensitive logs.

    Implement Audit Logging
        Track admin actions for accountability.
        Set up alerts for suspicious access.

    Secure File Transfers
        Ensure temporary files are securely deleted.
        Define maximum file size limits.
        Enforce file type validation.

    Prevent Memory Leaks (Message ID Cleanup)
        Implement a routine cleanup mechanism for message IDs.

Phase 3: Monitoring & Long-Term Security (Low Priority)

    Automate Security Checks
        Regular vulnerability scans.
        Automatic dependency updates.

    Implement User Activity Monitoring
        Track unusual behavior.
        Alert system for suspicious activities.

    Test Emergency & Recovery Plans
        Create and communicate an emergency contact list.
        Conduct security incident test scenarios.

    Develop a Security Dashboard
        Visualize security-related metrics.
        Provide an overview of error logs and audit logs.
